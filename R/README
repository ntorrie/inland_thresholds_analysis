Some of the inland threshold analysis was completed prior to data reprocessing
for the inland datasets. Thus, several versions of some of the scripts exist.

Final order in which scripts should be run, with the newest datsets, is as follows:

1.1_assemble_inland_data_new.R
2.1_explore_freshwater_params_grossrange.qmd
3_explore_freshwater_params_rollingsd.qmd
4_explore_human_in_the_loop.qmd
5_apply_all_flags.qmd

TODO:
Archive old files, refresh newer ones and add documentation/rationale

While replacing files, new names:
1.2_assemble_inland_data.R (replacing 1.1 and 1)
2.2_explore_inland_params_grossrange.qmd (replacing 2 and 2.1)
3.1_explore_inland_params_rollingsd.qmd (replacing 3)
4.1_explore_inland_params_hil.qmd (replacing 5)
